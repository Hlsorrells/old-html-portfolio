## Site Description
This is a three-page website that provides background information on myself on the home page, showcases links to some of my recent projects, and provides my contact information. I chose to go with a more modern but natural color palette as this seemed to be the best backdrop for my photos and easy on the eyes. I tried to make the site as readable as possible on large screen sizes by limiting the paragraph width to 75 characters and reducing the whitespace in the sections. I made the project GIFs large for better visibility of details and used the background color behind the GitHub repo links to help them stand out from their respective GIFs.

## Technology Used
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap

## Future Improvements
My next step will be to include some particle.js effects into my background.
