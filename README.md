## Site Description
This is a three-page website that provides background information on myself on the home page, showcases links to some of my recent projects, and provides my contact information. I chose to go with a more modern but natural color palette as this seemed to be the best backdrop for my photos and easy on the eyes.

## Technology Used
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap

## Future Improvements
My next step will be to include some particle.js effects into my background. During this step, I may take the time to revamp the layout of the pages to reduce the amount of whitespace. I also want to find a better way to display my project gifs as it was very hard working with their individual sizes as rendered on the page. I am investigating a few CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap to see if they might better fit my style of coding.
