                <p>
                    I am a “guardian of data” with a passion for cloud computing! But that is just part of who I am.
                    A careful planner with high attention to detail but brave enough to take strategic risks, I am a
                    bit
                    of an enigma. My hobbies include hiking through the woods, camping under the stars, reading a
                    good
                    book, and learning new computer software; but I had little time to dedicate to my hobbies as I
                    focused on pursuing my college education. My perseverance, determination, and adaptability are
                    evident as I have obtained my degree despite moving to four different states within six years
                    from
                    Wyoming to North Carolina. While I will always long for the Rocky Mountains and crisp snowy
                    mornings, I am pleased to return to my roots in the south near family and friends.

                <h2>My Background</h2>

                <!-- Section Article -->
                <p>
                    With many years of experience in bookkeeping and office administration, I have worked in a wide
                    variety of industries from manufacturing and service to banking and government. These positions
                    provided me with an opportunity to hone my critical thinking and organizational skills in
                    addition to developing my soft skills in communication and leadership. During my college
                    courses, I discovered an affinity for SQL databases and looked forward to the courses that
                    required building databases, creating complex queries, and designing data flow diagrams. This
                    new interest led me to pursue a certificate in full-stack web development which will enable me
                    to wrangle my data from front to back. My next pursuit will include learning more about data
                    pipelines and cloud architecture.

                <h2>My Education</h2>

                <!-- Section Article -->
                <p>
                    In May of 2020, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Management of Information Systems and
                    Business Analytics from Colorado State University-Global. When I began my college education
                    journey in 2014, I was studying to become a forensic accountant but changed my major to fit a
                    growing interest and passion for cloud computing. This journey of learning expanded my knowledge
                    of information systems, taught me new skills in data analytics, and revealed my love for coding.
                    I enrolled in the University of North Carolina-Charlotte’s Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp to
                    leverage my critical thinking, organization skills, and attention to detail with new skills in
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .NET, C#, Node.js, React, MySQL, and MongoDB. This combination of college
                    degree and hands-on experience has provided me with a solid foundation on which to build my new
                    career.
