            I am a “guardian of data” with a passion for cloud computing along with the flow and security of data. While completing my MIS degree, I discovered a love for SQL with its logic, data structures, and data flow diagrams as I coded new databases and developed complex queries. I studied cloud computing and how it solves many problems that small businesses face with managing their data safely and securely. But, how can I help others to find business solutions through cloud computing while enjoying my passion for building projects? As an ambitious problem solver, I pursued this question to discover another passion for coding and learning new program languages.

            Having worked in a wide variety of industries from manufacturing and service to banking and government, I have learned how various industries operate and have become adept at applying my current skills to new demands while seeking to build new skills and knowledge for continued growth. My MIS degree coupled with a strong background in office administration and bookkeeping provides me with the foundational skills in business and data analysis on which to build my technical skills in computer programming. Currently, I am enrolled in a full-stack web development program to leverage my critical thinking, organization skills, and attention to detail with new skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .NET, C#, ASP.NET, Node.js, React, MySQL, and MongoDB.
        </p>

            My goal is to combine my passions for data and cloud computing by developing a career as a data engineer or solutions architect. With hard work and perseverance, I look forward to the new and exciting challenges that are awaiting me.
